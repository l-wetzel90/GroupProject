1. On a failed login get notice: Notice: Undefined offset: 0 in C:\xampp\htdocs\groupw-teamb\database.php on line 104
This happens if the alias doesn't exist in the DB.

2. The error messages of just Invalid Email or Invalid Alias if they are already taken aren't specific enough, the user should be told that they are already in use and to choose another.

3. 100 chars is too short for a image name, should be the windows limit of 255 or you risk truncation.

Issues with alias requirements, you should be more restrictive about the special characters allowed. Look to this for some guidance on what characters will disrupt a windows path: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365247

4. Usernames with % break the image output. I created users with aliases of %%%% and %2F..%2F any I can upload an image and see in the image in the directory but it isn't displayed on the page. Try using urlencode http://php.net/manual/en/function.urlencode.php

5. Had a User alias of "C:  " and when trying to upload an image:
