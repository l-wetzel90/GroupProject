Good work.

1. For validation.php instead of counting up to the valid number of pieces of data it's often easier to just have a boolean flag, flipping the flag to false if data is INvalid, instead of ++ when you valid data. So if you add more fields to validate you won't have to change the numeric literal 4.

For the 2nd version of the website I would suggest moving these into functions.
